This site contains example code that goes with a forthcoming document from the OCTO document series
that describes how to do random candidate selection.

The code, [candidate-selection.py](candidate-selection.py), can be used by those who need to make a
random selection among a group of names. It uses a method, to be published in the forthcoming OCTO
document, "A Verifiable and Reproducible Random Candidate Selection Process".
The steps for running the program are in the comments at the top of the program.
