This site contains example code that goes with [ICANN OCTO-41: A Verifiable and Reproducible Random Candidate Selection Process](https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/octo-041-25feb25-en.pdf). OCTO-41 describes how to do random candidate selection.

The code, [candidate-selection.py](candidate-selection.py), can be used by those who need to make a
random selection among a group of names.

The steps for running the program are in the comments at the top of the program.
